# Ant Colony Simulation with Reinforcement Learning

This project simulates ant colonies using reinforcement learning to develop efficient foraging strategies. The simulation uses PyTorch for the RL implementation and PyX for visualization.

## Features

- Multiple ant colonies competing for food resources
- Diverse reinforcement learning policies for ant behavior optimization
- Neuroevolutionary algorithm across multiple ant generations
- Pheromone-based communication between ants
- Real-time visualization using RayLib
- Configurable simulation parameters
- Save/load trained models
